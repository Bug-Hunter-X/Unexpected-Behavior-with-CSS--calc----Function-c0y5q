The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations, but it can sometimes lead to unexpected results if not used correctly. For example, using `calc(100% - 10px)` might not work as expected if the parent element doesn't have a defined width.  Another issue can be caused by incorrect operator precedence or missing spaces around operators. A common mistake is to forget that percentages are relative to the parent element's property, so if the parent element hasn't been sized yet, the result is undefined.
