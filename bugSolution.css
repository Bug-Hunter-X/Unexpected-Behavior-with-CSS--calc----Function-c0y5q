To fix issues with `calc()`, ensure that:

1. **Parent element has a defined width:** If using percentages within `calc()`, the parent element must have its width explicitly set (either directly or through its own parent element).
2. **Correct operator precedence:** Use parentheses `()` to control the order of operations in complex calculations. 
3. **Spaces around operators:** Include spaces around operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) in `calc()` to ensure that they are parsed correctly.

Here's an example of correcting an erroneous usage:

```css
/* Incorrect: Percentage calculation on an element with undefined width */
#element { width: calc(100% - 10px); }

/* Correct: Set parent width and ensure correct spacing */
.parent {
  width: 500px; /* Define parent's width */
}

#element { width: calc(100% - 10px); }
```
By carefully considering these points, you can avoid many issues when utilizing `calc()` effectively in your CSS.
